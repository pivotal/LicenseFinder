With bundler it's easy for your project to depend on many gems.  This decomposition is nice, but managing licenses becomes difficult.  This tool gathers info about the licenses of the gems in your project.

## Installation

Add license_finder to your project's Gemfile and `bundle`:

```ruby
gem 'license_finder'
```

## Usage

License finder will generate reports of action items - i.e., dependencies that do not fall within your license "whitelist".

```sh
$ license_finder
```

The first time you run this, `license_finder` will create a default configuration file `./config/license_finder.yml`:


```yaml
---
whitelist:
#- MIT
#- Apache 2.0
ignore_groups:
#- test
#- development
dependencies_file_dir: './doc/'
```

This allows you to configure bundler groups and add licenses to the whitelist.

On a brand new Rails project, you could expect `license_finder` to output something like the following
(assuming you whitelisted the MIT license in your `config/license_finder.yml`):

```
Dependencies that need approval:

highline, 1.6.14, ruby
json, 1.7.5, ruby
mime-types, 1.19, ruby
rails, 3.2.8, other
rdoc, 3.12, other
rubyzip, 0.9.9, ruby
xml-simple, 1.1.1, other
```

The executable task will also write out a dependencies.db, dependencies.txt, and dependencies.html file in the doc/ directory (by default).

The latter two files are human readable reports that you could send to your non-technical business partners, lawyers, etc.

`license_finder` will also return a non-zero exit status if there are
unapproved dependencies. You could use this in a CI build, for example, to alert you whenever someone adds an
unapproved dependency to the project.

### Manually recording licenses

When you have dependencies marked as having an 'other' license, `license_finder` you should manually research what the actual license is. Once this has been established, you can record this information with the `-l` or `--license` option as such:

```sh
$ license_finder -l MIT my_unknown_dependency
```

This command would assign the MIT license to the dependency `my_unknown_dependency`.

### Manually approving dependencies

Whenever you have a dependency that falls outside of your whitelist, `license_finder` will tell you.
If your business decides that this is an acceptable risk, you can manually approve the dependency by using the `-a` or
`--approve` option of the `license_finder` command.

For example, lets assume you've only
whitelisted the "MIT" license in your `config/license_finder.yml`. You then add the `awesome_gpl_gem` to your Gemfile,
which we'll assume is licensed with the `GPL` license. You then run `license_finder` and see
the gem listed in the output:

```txt
awesome_gpl_gem, 1.0.0, GPL
```

Your business tells you that in this case, it's acceptable to use this gem. You now run:

```sh
$ license_finder -a awesome_gpl_gem
```

If you rerun `license_finder`, you should no longer see `awesome_gpl_gem` in the output.

## Compatibility

license_finder is compatible with ruby 1.9, and ruby 2.0. There is also experimental support for jruby.

## A note to gem authors / maintainers

For the good of humanity, please add a license to your gemspec!

```ruby
Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name = "my_great_gem"
  s.license = "MIT"
end
```

And add a `LICENSE` file to your gem that contains your license text.
