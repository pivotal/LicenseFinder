Goal
====

With bundler it's easy for your project to depend on many gems.  This decomposition is nice, but managing licenses becomes difficult.  This tool gathers info about the licenses of the gems in your project.

Usage
=====

For a Rails project add license_finder to your Gemfile:
    gem 'license_finder', :git => "https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder.git"

Run 'rake license:init'
This will create a config/license_finder.yml file that lets you configure license finder.

Run 'rake license:generate_dependencies'
This will write out a dependencies.yml and dependencies.txt file in the root of your project. 
It will also merge in an existing dependencies.yml file, if one exists.

Run 'rake license:action_items'
This will output a list of unapproved dependencies to the console

As a standalone script:
    cd ~
    git clone http://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder.git license_finder
    cd your/project
    ~/license_finder/bin/license_finder

Optionally add `--with-licenses` to include the full text of the licenses in the output.
