# 2.0.0 / 2015-03-02

* Features

  * Stores every decision that has been made about a project's dependencies,
    even if a decision was later reverted.  These decisions are kept in an
    append-only YAML file which can be considered an audit log.
  * Stores timestamps and other optional transactional metadata (who, why)
    about every kind of decision.
  * When needed, applies those decisions to the list of packages currently
    reported by the package managers.
  * Removed dependencies on sqlite and sequel.
  * The CLI never writes HTML or CSV reports to the file system, only to
    STDOUT. So, users have more choice over which reports to generate, when to
    generate them, and where to put them. See `license_finder report`.  If you
    would like to update reports automatically (e.g., in a rake task or git
    hook) see this gist: https://gist.github.com/mainej/1a4d61a92234c5cebeab.
  * The configuration YAML file is no longer required, though it can still be
    useful.  Most of its functionality has been moved into the decisions
    infrastructure, and the remaining bits can be passed as arguments to the
    CLI.  Most users will not need these arguments.  If the file is present, the
    CLI arguments can be omitted.  The CLI no longer updates this file.
  * Requires pip >= 6.0
